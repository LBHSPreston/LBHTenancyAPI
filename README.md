## Setup

## Running the tests
Run `docker-compose run --rm stubuniversalhousing` to bring up the stub data source. Tests run against this in order to simulate the legacy data source.

You can now run the tests using the test explorer in your IDE (we've used Rider and Visual Studio CE on Mac)

TODO: Add xunit console runner to run tests from cli
TODO: Create script to spin up and create stub UH and then run tests

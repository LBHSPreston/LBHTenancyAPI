FROM [dbo].[arag] arag
INNER JOIN [dbo].[aragdet] aragdet
ON arag.arag_sid = aragdet.arag_sid
LEFT JOIN [dbo].[lookup] frequency_lookup
ON aragdet.aragdet_frequency = frequency_lookup.lu_ref
LEFT JOIN [dbo].[lookup] status_lookup
ON arag.arag_status = status_lookup.lu_ref
WHERE arag.tag_ref = '000075/01'
